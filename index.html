          <li>Push your changes to the new/working branch using 'push origin new/workingbranchname'</li>
          <li>Navigate to GitHub and use the Compare and Pull request button</li>

          <li>Create a Pull Request(PR)</li>
          <li>Ready for review and feedback</li>
          <li>Once approved, it is then merged.</li>
          <li>Once merged, perform a 'pull origin main' to be sure you're up-to-date on your code in VS</li>
          <li>moe note: If you do a pull origin main, then you have a recent copy. However before you start coding again, check the status and make sure you have the most recent version.</li>
          <li>before you start coding, make sure you have a new branch you will be working with and also do the "add -A" so it initializes you making changes to this new branch.</li>
          <li>you always have to do a "add -A to stage your changes before you commit them.</li>
