# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide is designed to act as a single point of reference for notes, tips and other guiding information during the coursework for the Rutgers Bootcamp sessions. This guide begins with basic notes for HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. Creating this guide uses the skills neccessary to build a good foundation for learning deeper skills that are required to become a full stack developer. By practicing these skills, especially the Github experience, these processes and skills become second nature allowing us to explore more in depth concepts and principals in the development world. Learn, apply and practice. Learn, apply, practice.
